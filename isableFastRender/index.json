The identification of coherent structures in these flows is essential for understanding the underlying physical mechanisms and for developing efficient reduced-order models. Modal analysis provides systematic tools for this decomposition, allowing the extraction of dominant flow patterns.\nConcept of Coherent Structures # Coherent structures are organized spatial and temporal patterns that emerge in turbulent flows and carry a significant portion of the system\u0026rsquo;s energy and dynamics. Examples include vortices, pressure waves, or periodic oscillation patterns. Identifying them is crucial for understanding momentum transport, energy dissipation, and instabilities in fluid flows.\nClassical Modal Analysis Techniques # The main techniques for modal decomposition in fluid dynamics include:\nProper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD): Identifies modes that maximize the mean flow energy, revealing the most energetic and dominant structures. Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD): Decomposes the flow into dynamic modes associated with specific frequencies and growth rates, enabling the analysis of oscillatory patterns and instabilities. These approaches allow for the separation of relevant flow components, facilitating the study of the underlying dynamics and interactions across scales.\nApplications in Modeling and Simulation # The identification of coherent modes enables the construction of Reduced-Order Models (ROMs), which simplify the simulation of complex systems:\nReduce the computational cost of large-scale simulations. Allow parametric analyses and the study of instabilities. Provide support for flow control and fluid system optimization. Concluding Remarks # Modal analysis is a powerful tool to decompose, understand, and model complex flows, providing simplified representations that preserve the essential dynamics of the system. Its application significantly contributes to advances in simulation, prediction, and control in fluid dynamics.\n","date":"2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/research/research3/","section":"","summary":"Application of the Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) technique to identify and understand coherent structures (or modes) that dominate the spatial and temporal behavior of a fluid flow.","title":"Modal Analysis of Fluid Dynamics","type":"research"},{"content":"","date":"2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/numerical-analysis/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Numerical Analysis","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/scientific-computing/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Scientific Computing","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/transport-phenomena/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Transport Phenomena","type":"tags"},{"content":" Numerical Methods for Solving Differential Equations in Transport Phenomena # Transport phenomena (heat transfer, mass diffusion, and fluid flow) are governed by differential equations, often derived from the conservation laws of mass, energy, and momentum. The mathematical formulation of these problems generally leads to partial differential equations (PDEs), whose analytical solution is possible only in simplified cases, involving regular geometries, idealized boundary conditions, and restrictive assumptions (Incropera et al., 2007). Given the complexity of real systems, the use of numerical methods becomes indispensable.\nGeneral Formulation # Transport equations can be expressed in a unified form by the advection-diffusion equation, which describes the variation of a conserved scalar \\(\\phi\\) in space and time:\n\\[ \\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial t} + \\nabla \\cdot (\\mathbf{u} \\phi) = \\nabla \\cdot (\\Gamma \\nabla \\phi) + S \\]where \\(\\mathbf{u}\\) is the velocity field, \\(\\Gamma\\) is the diffusion coefficient, and \\(S\\) is a source term. The solution of this equation, as well as its variants (including the Navier–Stokes equations) requires the discretization of the continuous domain into a finite number of points, elements, or control volumes.\nMain Numerical Methods # 1. Finite Difference Method (FDM) # This method replaces spatial and temporal derivatives with approximations based on Taylor series expansions. It is particularly suitable for one-dimensional problems and structured grids and is classically applied in transient heat conduction problems (Chapra \u0026amp; Canale, 2015).\n2. Finite Volume Method (FVM) # This method is based on integrating the conservation equations over control volumes and applying the divergence theorem. It ensures both local and global conservation of transported quantities and is widely used in computational fluid dynamics (Patankar, 1980; Versteeg \u0026amp; Malalasekera, 2007).\n3. Finite Element Method (FEM) # This approach is founded on a variational formulation, in which the solution is approximated by shape functions defined over elements forming the mesh. It stands out for its flexibility in handling complex geometries and arbitrary boundary conditions, being extensively applied in multiphysics problems (Zienkiewicz \u0026amp; Taylor, 2000).\n4. Spectral Methods # These methods employ global basis functions (such as Chebyshev polynomials or Fourier series), providing high accuracy for problems in regular domains. They have been applied to the study of hydrodynamic instabilities and modal analysis of flows (Canuto et al., 2006).\nNumerical and Computational Aspects # Regardless of the chosen method, three fundamental properties must be ensured: consistency, stability, and convergence. The stability criterion, often associated with the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) condition, is particularly relevant in explicit methods. In addition, truncation and discretization error analysis is required to guarantee reliable results (Ferziger \u0026amp; Perić, 2002).\nFinal Considerations # The choice of the numerical method strongly depends on the characteristics of the transport problem under study. While FDM is efficient in simple geometries, FVM stands out for its local conservation properties in complex flows, and FEM provides great versatility in irregular domains. Spectral methods, in turn, are preferred in analyses that demand high numerical accuracy. With the increase in computational power and the development of optimized algorithms, these numerical approaches have become indispensable tools in the modeling and simulation of transport phenomena.\nDownloads # Final Course Monograph ","date":"2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/research/research2/","section":"","summary":"Application of the numerical method of lines (NUMOL) to solve the classical problem of one-dimensional heat transfer in a cylinder.","title":"Numerical Methods for Simulating Transport Phenomena","type":"research"},{"content":" Abstract # Several graphical methods have been developed to understand the stratigraphy observed in wells and assist experts in estimating rock quality, deﬁning limits for barriers, bafﬂes, and speed zones, and in particular, delineating hydraulic ﬂow units.

The main goal is to predict oil, gas, and water production, optimize development strategies, and manage the field\u0026rsquo;s lifespan. This simulation involves solving complex equations that describe the flow of fluids (oil, gas, and water) through a porous medium (the reservoir rock) under various pressure and temperature conditions.\nTypes of Numerical Grids # The numerical grid is the discretization of the reservoir volume into smaller cells, where the flow equations are solved. The choice of grid type directly impacts the simulation\u0026rsquo;s accuracy and computational efficiency. Common types include:\nCartesian: These are the simplest, formed by rectangular or cubic cells. They\u0026rsquo;re easy to build and suitable for reservoirs with simple geometries and horizontal layers. However, they don\u0026rsquo;t represent complex geometries or faults well. Unstructured Grids: These offer great flexibility to adapt to complex geometries, such as faults, channels, and lenses, using cells of various shapes (triangles, tetrahedrons). They are more complex to build and computationally more demanding. Corner-Point Grid: This is a structured, yet flexible, grid type widely used in reservoir modeling. Each cell is defined by eight corner points (vertices), allowing the cell faces to be neither necessarily planar nor perpendicular. The main advantage of the Corner-Point grid is its ability to represent geological faults and dipping layers with greater accuracy than Cartesian grids, while maintaining an organized structure that facilitates cell indexing. This allows the grid to deform to follow the stratigraphy and discontinuities of the reservoir. Although more complex to build than a Cartesian grid, it\u0026rsquo;s significantly less complex than an unstructured grid, making it a good compromise between geometric precision and computational efficiency for most reservoir cases.\nReservoir Characterization # Reservoir characterization is the process of defining the reservoir\u0026rsquo;s geological and petrophysical properties. This involves integrating data from various sources, such as:\nGeology: Analysis of cores, well logs, and seismic data to understand the structure, stratigraphy, sedimentology, and identification of faults and fractures. Petrophysics: Measurement and interpretation of rock properties (porosity, permeability, fluid saturation) obtained from well logs and laboratory analyses. Production Data: Historical oil, gas, and water production from wells, reservoir pressures, and well tests, which provide dynamic information about the reservoir\u0026rsquo;s behavior. The accuracy of the characterization is fundamental, as it defines the input parameters for the numerical model. A poorly characterized model will produce unrealistic results.\nPetrophysics # Petrophysics is the study of the physical properties of rocks that influence fluid flow in porous media. The main petrophysical properties for numerical modeling include:\nPorosity ($\\phi$): This is the fraction of the total rock volume occupied by pores (void spaces) where fluids can be stored. It\u0026rsquo;s a measure of the reservoir\u0026rsquo;s storage capacity. Permeability ($k$): This is the ability of the rock to allow fluids to flow through its interconnected pores. It\u0026rsquo;s a measure of the reservoir\u0026rsquo;s hydraulic conductivity. Fluid Saturation ($S_o$, $S_g$, $S_w$): Represents the fraction of the pore volume occupied by each fluid type (oil, gas, water). The sum of saturations must equal 1. Compressibility ($c$): Measures the change in rock or fluid volume in response to a pressure change. Hydraulic Flow Units # A hydraulic flow unit is a continuous and mappable volume of reservoir rock that shares consistent geological and petrophysical characteristics, sufficiently so to control fluid flow in a similar manner. This means that within a flow unit, porosity and permeability (and their relationships with fluid saturation) are relatively homogeneous, simplifying flow modeling. Identifying and mapping these units is crucial for simplifying the reservoir model and ensuring that petrophysical properties are correctly assigned within the numerical grid.\nFlow in Porous Media # Flow in porous media is the study of fluid movement (oil, gas, water) through the network of pores and pore throats of a reservoir rock. This process is governed by physical laws, with Darcy\u0026rsquo;s Law being the basis for describing flow in laminar regimes:\n$$ q = - \\dfrac{kA}{\\mu} \\dfrac{dP}{dx}$$Where:\n$q$ is the volumetric flow rate $k$ is the permeability of the porous medium $A$ is the cross-sectional area $\\mu$ is the fluid viscosity $\\frac{dP}{dx}$ is the pressure gradient Numerical modeling extends Darcy\u0026rsquo;s Law to multiple phases (oil, gas, water) and to heterogeneous and anisotropic media, also considering the effects of gravity and capillarity.\nBlack-Oil Model # The Black-Oil model is one of the most common and widely used models for reservoir simulation. It\u0026rsquo;s a simplified compositional model that treats oil and gas as binary mixtures or pseudocomponents. The central premise is that gas can dissolve in oil and oil can evaporate into gas, but there is no mass exchange between the individual components of each phase (e.g., light components of oil don\u0026rsquo;t separate into a pure gas phase, and heavy components of gas don\u0026rsquo;t liquefy into a pure oil phase).\nIn the Black-Oil model, fluids are typically described by:\nFormation Volume Factor (FVF): Relates the volume of a phase (oil or gas) at the surface to its volume in the reservoir. Gas-Oil Ratio (GOR): The amount of gas that separates from the oil under surface conditions. Viscosity: The resistance to flow for each phase. Bubble Point Pressure / Dew Point Pressure: The pressures at which gas begins to separate from oil or oil begins to condense from gas, respectively. This model is computationally efficient and suitable for most light oil and dry gas reservoirs. However, for reservoirs with more complex fluids (such as heavy oil, gas condensates, or high-pressure gas injection), more sophisticated compositional models may be necessary.\nRelated Material # The MATLAB Reservoir Simulation Toolbox (MRST) is a free open-source software for reservoir modelling and simulation, developed primarily by the Applied Computational Science group in the Department of Mathematics and Cybernetics at SINTEF Digital.\n","date":"2019","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/research/research1/","section":"","summary":"Computational representation of the physical and geological characteristics of oil wells.","title":"Numerical Modeling and Characterization of Oil Reservoirs","type":"research"},{"content":" Abstract # The motivation of this work is to study the well location in 3D modelling reservoir with heterogeneous permeability behavior between different well location approaches.

Based on the fundamental principles of mass, momentum, and energy conservation, it is possible to mathematically describe fluid flow, whether in simple scenarios such as pipe flow or in complex cases involving turbulence or interactions with moving surfaces.

Here, modal analysis refers to the decomposition of the flow field into spatial modes or coherent structures, which represent the main dynamic features of the system.

Among them, Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) stands out as a data-driven method that extracts spatial modes associated with specific frequencies and growth or decay rates, enabling the reconstruction of the systemâ€™s temporal behavior from a reduced basis. DMD operates directly on datasets, whether from simulations or measurements, and reveals how different structures contribute to the dynamic evolution of the flow, facilitating both physical interpretation and the development of reduced-order models. Other techniques, such as Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) or Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD), are also widely used to extract the most energetic components of the flow, although they are not directly linked to the temporal dynamics, as is the case with DMD.\nThus, the integration of fluid mechanics, CFD, and modal decomposition techniques establishes a virtuous cycle: simulations provide large amounts of representative flow data; modal analysis organizes this data, extracting dominant patterns and structures; and the knowledge gained feeds back into the development of more efficient predictive models and the improvement of industrial and scientific designs. In this context, a deep understanding of dynamic modes and coherent structures not only enriches the interpretation of complex flows but also offers paths for their control and optimization.\n",

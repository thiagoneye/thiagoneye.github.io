Here, modal analysis refers to the decomposition of the flow field into spatial modes or coherent structures, which represent the main dynamic features of the system.

In this context, a deep understanding of dynamic modes and coherent structures not only enriches the interpretation of complex flows but also offers paths for their control and optimization.\n",

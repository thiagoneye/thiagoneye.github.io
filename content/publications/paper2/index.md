## Abstract

Reservoir characterizations is greatly relevant for the oil and gas industry, especially for identification of regions with high production potential. Such high-performance zones can be modelled as flow units recognizable through a broad class of methods existing in the literature. This paper is intended to review the main graphical methods used for petrophysical analysis of wellbores in reservoirs to determine rock types, quantify heterogeneity, delineate, and classify flow units. With using a computational code implemented on top of the MRST (MATLAB Reservoir Simulation Toolbox) tool, we applied the methods to a sandstone heterogeneous reservoir model called PSY (LaMEP/UFPB) to illustrate.

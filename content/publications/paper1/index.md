## Abstract

The motivation of this work is to study the well location in 3D modelling reservoir with heterogeneous permeability behavior between different well location approaches. We aim to identify spots that improve the oil production through two versions of the flow zone indicator, termed FZI and FZI*, which are quantities statistically distributed throughout the porous medium and computed through linear regression. Using rock cluster determined by applying previous permeability average rules, it is possible to verify the reservoir clustering responses in high fluidity zones. Furthermore, production wells are placed strategically at points determined by each approach and subsequently a comparative between all the possibilities averages is shown after long period flow computational simulations performed by the Matlab® Reservoir Simulation Toolbox - MRST.

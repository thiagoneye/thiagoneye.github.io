## Abstract

Several graphical methods have been developed to understand the stratigraphy observed in wells and assist experts in estimating rock quality, deﬁning limits for barriers, bafﬂes, and speed zones, and in particular, delineating hydraulic ﬂow units. At present, there exists no computational tool that bundles the main graphical methods used for deﬁning ﬂow units. This paper introduces an add-on module to the MATLAB Reservoir Simulation Toolbox that contains computational routines to carry out such graphical analyses, both qualitatively and quantitatively. We also describe a new secondary method deﬁned as the derivative of the stratigraphic modiﬁed Lorenz plot, which we use to classify depth ranges within the reservoir into barriers, strong bafﬂes, weak bafﬂes, and normal units, based on ﬂow unit speed over those depths. We demonstrate the capabilities of the “Graphical Analysis for Well Placement Strategy” module by applying it to several case studies of both real and synthetic reservoirs.

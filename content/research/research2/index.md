## Description

Flight Dynamics Analysis and Control Surface Design is a field of aerospace engineering that involves studying the motion of an aircraft in terms of aerodynamic forces and moments to ensure stability, controllability, and appropriate dynamic response across all flight conditions. This includes analyzing the aircraft's behavior around its three rotational axes (pitch, yaw, and roll) as well as designing and optimizing control surfaces such as elevators, rudders, and ailerons. These surfaces enable the pilot or flight control system to guide and maintain the aircraftâ€™s attitude and trajectory efficiently. The integration of flight dynamics and control surface design is essential for ensuring maneuverability, aerodynamic efficiency, and flight safety in aircraft, drones, rockets, and missiles.

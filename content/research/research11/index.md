## The Fight Against Climate Change: From Decarbonization to Artificial Intelligence in Carbon Capture

The urgency imposed by global climate change has accelerated the search for innovative and effective solutions to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and mitigate their impacts. In this context, concepts like decarbonization and "Net Zero" have become central, driving the development of advanced technologies such as Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage (CCUS). More recently, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged as a powerful tool capable of optimizing and accelerating the implementation of CCUS projects, opening new frontiers in the fight against global warming.

### Climate Change and Greenhouse Gases: The Global Challenge

Climate change refers to the long-term shifts in the Earth's temperature and weather patterns. Although climatic variations are natural, human activities, especially since the Industrial Revolution, have drastically intensified this process. The primary cause is the emission of greenhouse gases, which act like a blanket around the Earth, trapping the sun's heat and raising the global average temperature.

The main GHGs include:

* **Carbon Dioxide ($CO_2$):** The most abundant and well-known, primarily from the burning of fossil fuels (coal, oil, and natural gas) for energy generation, transportation, and industrial activities, as well as from deforestation.

* **Methane ($CH_4$):** Emitted from agricultural activities (like livestock farming), landfills, and the production and transport of fossil fuels. It has a significantly higher warming potential than $CO_2$ over a short-term horizon.

* **Nitrous Oxide ($N_2O$):** Originating from the use of fertilizers in agriculture, the burning of fossil fuels, and industrial processes.

The consequences of the increased concentration of these gases in the atmosphere are vast and include rising sea levels, more frequent and intense extreme weather events (droughts, floods, heatwaves), biodiversity loss, and threats to food and water security.

### Decarbonization and the 'Net Zero' Goal: Towards a Sustainable Future

To address the climate challenge, the global community has set ambitious goals. Decarbonization is the process of reducing carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere. This can be achieved through various strategies, such as transitioning to renewable energy sources (solar, wind), increasing energy efficiency across all sectors of the economy, and adopting circular economy practices.

The concept of "Net Zero" takes it a step further. Reaching Net Zero means that the balance between GHG emissions released into the atmosphere and the removal of these gases is equal to zero. In other words, any residual emissions that are very difficult or impossible to eliminate must be offset by removing an equivalent amount of GHGs from the atmosphere. This is the central goal of the Paris Agreement, which aims to limit global warming to well below $2^\circ C$, preferably to $1.5^\circ C$, compared to pre-industrial levels.

### CCUS Technologies: Capturing, Utilizing, and Storing Carbon

Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage (CCUS) technologies are a suite of processes that play a crucial role in the journey to Net Zero, especially for industrial sectors where complete decarbonization is challenging. The process is divided into three main stages:

* **Capture:** $CO_2$ is captured from large emission sources, such as power plants, steel mills, and cement factories. There are different capture technologies, including post-combustion (which separates $CO_2$ from exhaust gases), pre-combustion (which removes carbon from the fuel before burning), and oxy-combustion (which uses pure oxygen instead of air in combustion to generate a concentrated stream of $CO_2$).

* **Utilization:** The captured $CO_2$ can be transported and used as a feedstock for creating various products, such as plastics, synthetic fuels, construction materials, and chemicals. Another form of utilization is in Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR), where $CO_2$ is injected into oil reservoirs to increase extraction, with a portion of the gas being permanently stored underground.

* **Storage:** When utilization is not feasible or desired, the $CO_2$ is transported (usually via pipelines) and injected into deep, secure geological formations, such as depleted oil and gas reservoirs, saline aquifers, or unmineable coal seams. The goal is to store the carbon permanently, preventing its release into the atmosphere.

### The Role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Optimizing CCUS

Artificial Intelligence is becoming an indispensable ally in making CCUS technologies more efficient, cost-effective, and secure. Its applications span all stages of the process:

* In Carbon Capture: AI and machine learning algorithms can accelerate the discovery and development of new materials and solvents with a higher capacity for $CO_2$ absorption. IBM, for example, has used AI to identify promising molecules for creating more effective carbon separation membranes.

* In Carbon Utilization: AI can optimize the processes of converting $CO_2$ into value-added products by controlling reaction variables in real-time to maximize efficiency and product quality. In Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR), AI models analyze geological and production data to optimize $CO_2$ injection, maximizing oil recovery and gas storage.

* In Carbon Storage: The selection and characterization of geological storage sites are complex and expensive processes. AI can analyze vast sets of geophysical data to identify the safest formations with the greatest storage potential. Furthermore, machine learning systems can continuously monitor storage sites, analyzing seismic and pressure data to predict and prevent potential leaks, ensuring the long-term safety and permanence of the stored carbon. Tools using AI and remote sensing are already being employed to monitor carbon credit areas, validating the effectiveness of the storage.

The integration of Artificial Intelligence into CCUS technologies represents a quantum leap in the fight against climate change. By optimizing each stage of the process, AI not only enhances the technical and economic viability of carbon capture and storage but also reinforces the safety and reliability of these technologies, making them an even stronger pillar in building a Net Zero future.

## Abstract

Industrial management aims to ensure efficient, effective, and profitable production within a complex and dynamic manufacturing environment, which presents numerous challenges such as machine idleness, shortage of skilled labor, supply chain disruptions, and difficulties in information integration. Additionally, Production Planning and Control (PPC) faces obstacles related to demand forecasting, inventory management, production capacity, and the need to adapt to unforeseen events. In this context, industrial process optimization is essential to eliminate waste, standardize operations, and implement advanced technologies. Operations Research (OR) emerges as a strategic tool to address this complexity by enabling mathematical modeling, optimization of the production mix, assembly line balancing, sequencing, and generation of optimized Gantt charts. As a result, OR enables robust and resilient decision-making, boosting industrial competitiveness in the face of market uncertainties and variability.

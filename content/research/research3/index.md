## Abstract

Numerical modeling and characterization of petroleum reservoirs involve building computational representations based on geological, seismic, and petrophysical data to simulate fluid behavior and optimize production. In this context, petrophysics plays a key role by providing parameters such as porosity, permeability, and saturation, which define the rock’s capacity to store and transmit fluids. For efficient modeling and reservoir management, the system is divided into hydraulic flow units—zones with homogeneous properties that facilitate dynamic performance prediction. This entire process is grounded in the study of flow through porous media, where laws such as Darcy’s describe the movement of fluids through the rock’s pore spaces, making this understanding essential to reservoir engineering.

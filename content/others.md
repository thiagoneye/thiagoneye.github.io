## Laboratories

* **[TRIL Lab's](https://tril.ci.ufpb.br/)** proposal lies on a conceptual triad which is the reason for its name: SEIZE, SHAPE, and SOLVE. This holistic “3S” model intends to deploy a portfolio of solutions for strategic sectors of our economy and society. Our focus is computational science and engineering (CSE).

## Tools

* With the Data Intelligence Platform, **[Databricks](https://www.databricks.com/)** democratizes insights to everyone in an organization.

* The **[MATLAB Reservoir Simulation Toolbox (MRST)](https://www.sintef.no/projectweb/mrst/)** is a free open-source software for reservoir modelling and simulation, developed primarily by the Applied Computational Science group in the Department of Mathematics and Cybernetics at SINTEF Digital.

* The **[SciML](https://sciml.ai/)** organization is a collection of tools for solving equations and modeling systems developed in the Julia programming language with bindings to other languages such as R and Python.

* The **[OpenFOAM](https://www.openfoam.com/)** is the free, open source CFD software developed. It has a large user base across most areas of engineering and science, from both commercial and academic organisations. OpenFOAM has an extensive range of features to solve anything from complex fluid flows involving chemical reactions, turbulence and heat transfer, to acoustics, solid mechanics and electromagnetics.

* The **[ParaView](https://www.paraview.org/)** is an award-winning open source visualization application that users have trusted for more than 20 years.

* The **[FEniCS](https://fenicsproject.org/)** is a popular open-source computing platform for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) with the finite element method (FEM). FEniCS enables users to quickly translate scientific models into efficient finite element code.

* The **[Gmsh](https://gmsh.info/)** is a three-dimensional finite element mesh generator with built-in pre- and post-processing facilities.

* **[Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/)** is a Free and open source vector graphics editor for GNU/Linux, Windows and macOS. It offers a rich set of features and is widely used for both artistic and technical illustrations such as cartoons, clip art, logos, typography, diagramming and flowcharting.
